"""Domain capability implementations.

Each module in this package provides a DomainCapability subclass for a specific
external system the agent can interact with.

Current modules:
  workday.py — WorkdayCapability stub (no real API connected yet)

Planned:
  flowise.py  — Move FlowiseCapability here from graph.py (Milestone 3 cleanup)

To add a new domain, see "How to Add a New Domain" in
roadmap3_architecture_optimization.md.
